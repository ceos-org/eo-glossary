# Ancillary Data

## 1 Definition

[Data](../data) acquired on the same platform but not obtained from the main [Sensor](../sensor) itself (usually provided as part of Level 0 [Data](../data)). They have the primary purpose to serve the processing of main instrument [Data](../data) (e.g. [Position](../position) and velocity of platform).

### Notes 
This can be divided into [data](../data) referred to as spacecraft ‘engineering’, ‘core housekeeping’ or ‘subsystem’ [data](../data) obtained from other parts of the platform and includes parameters such as orbit [position](../position) and velocity, attitude and its
range of change, time, temperatures, pressures, jet firings, water dumps, internally produced magnet fields, and other environmental [measurements](../measurement). Ancillary refers to [data](../data) that exist purely to serve the [data](../data) processing.

## 2 Definition

[Data](../data) other than instrument [measurements](../measurement), originating in the instrument itself or from the satellite, required to perform processing of the [Data](../data). They include orbit [Data](../data), attitude [Data](../data), time [Information](../information), and spacecraft engineering [Data](../data), [Calibration](../calibration) [Data](../data), [Data](../data) quality [Information](../information), and [Data](../data) from other instruments or earth system [models](../model).
