A (technical?) device or instrument suited (through physical/chemical interaction) to measure one or more properties of a Phenomenon and thus collect factual/objective Data.

### Notes 
- Sensing is therefore a synonym for Observation (the Process).
- As by their definition, sensors perform sampling.
- Sensors used to obtain measurements must be calibrated and provide uncertainties.
