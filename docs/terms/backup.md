# Backup

## 1 Definition

A general practice of making copies of current [baseline](../baseline) and derived [products](../product) of EO [Collections](../collection), in specified time intervals, and storing those copies in a manner that will not affect the [data](../data) if the primary distribution environment is compromised.

### Notes
- The emphasis is on the ability to retrieve a copy of the entire EO [Collection](../collection) on demand if the original [data](../data) is lost or compromised.
