# Spatial consistency

## 1 Definition

The spatial statistical properties of the [Data](../data) depend only on the underlaying physical [processes](../process) and donâ€™t depend on other factors such as fusing different [products](../product) or [sensors](../sensor). Also, the validity of the assumptions of the procedure to produce [Information](../information) holds true across the whole spatial range.
