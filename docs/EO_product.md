## 1 Definition

(indicative levels 2 and 3) are the direct output from standardized satellite data processing chains, representing fundamental geophysical and biophysical variables. These products demonstrate direct traceability to original satellite measurements through rigorous calibration and validation processes. The processing methodology prioritizes the conversion of raw sensor data into quantifiable physical measurements, maintaining strict adherence to standardized processing protocols and validation requirements.

### Examples 
- Soil moisture from microwave sensors 
- Land Surface Temperature (LST) from thermal measurements 
- Vegetation / phenology indices derived directly from satellite bands 

### Sources 
- KCEO
