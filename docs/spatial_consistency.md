# Spatial consistency

## 1 Definition

The spatial statistical properties of the data depend only on the underlaying physical processes and donâ€™t depend on other factors such as fusing different products or sensors. Also, the validity of the assumptions of the procedure to produce information holds true across the whole spatial range.
