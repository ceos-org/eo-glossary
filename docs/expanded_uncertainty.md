# Expanded uncertainty

## 1 Definition

Expanded Uncertainty is the Standard Uncertainty multiplied by a coverage factor, k. The coverage factor is chosen to obtain a desired level of confidence. Most commonly a 95% Confidence interval is chosen. For a Gaussian distribution, this is achieved with a coverage factor k = 2. (Note that strictly this provides a 95.45% Confidence interval).
