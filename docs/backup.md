# Backup

## 1 Definition

A general practice of making copies of current baseline and derived products of EO Collections, in specified time intervals, and storing those copies in a manner that will not affect the data if the primary distribution environment is compromised.

### Notes
- The emphasis is on the ability to retrieve a copy of the entire EO Collection on demand if the original data is lost or compromised.
