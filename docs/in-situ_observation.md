# In-Situ Observation

## 1 Definition 

Observations performed in the same Place where a Phenomenon occurs, normally without isolating it from other systems (its environment) or altering its pre-Observation state

### Notes 
- The main Characteristic of such observations is that distance has no or only negligible (within Uncertainty) influence on the Value of the Property observed. In-situ observations therefore often require either direct physical contact or small distances between a Sensor and the observed Phenomenon. 
- Observations not fulfilling these conditions are considered Remote Sensing
