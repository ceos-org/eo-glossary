## 1 Definition

(indicative level 4 and beyond) represent a higher level of processing and integration that goes beyond basic [Data](../data) processing. These outputs are often designed specifically for [Policy](../policy) or decision-making needs, and can be categorized into sub-categories:

- Outputs from [models](../model)/[Model](../model) Integration involves using EO products as inputs in numerical [models](../model) or combining them with other [Data](../data) sources in modeling frameworks. 
- Indicator-Based Outputs:  EO products are transformed through specialized algorithms (including statistical methods, machine learning, and pattern recognition) to create meaningful metrics based on spatio-temporal analysis.
- Outputs from Reanalysis: involves merging EO products with other [observations](../observation) and [models](../model), creating consistent long-term records of past atmospheric, oceanic, and land surface conditions, and filling gaps through [Data](../data) assimilation techniques.
