# Spatial extent

## 1 Definition

The zone or region of space described by a [Geographic Identifier](../geographic_identifier) in the form of a label or code, or by a bounding box. It consists in the maximum extent (the spatial boundary or limits) within which the [User](../user) is requesting [Data](../data).  

The attribute represents the maximum spatial extent of the AOI, and in case the AOI is made of many discontinuous zones then it represents the maximum extent of the union of all the zones. 

### Notes 
- WIGOS metadata standard defines it as the typical spatial georeferenced volume covered by the [observations](../observation) 

### Examples 

- if a [User](../user) is requesting [Information](../information) about degradation of African protected sites, then the AOIs are the protected sites, and the spatial extent is the African continent.
